            <aside>My name is Corey and I’m a fledgling full-stack web developer transitioning from the culinary world. After ten years as a professional chef, I’m taking my attention to detail and creative thirst to a new industry. My time as a chef taught me many skills that will transfer to the web world - patience, creativity, multi-tasking, leadership, and perfectionism, to name a few.</aside>
            <aside>No, I won’t bake you cookies. But I WILL make you a kick-ass, responsive, and modern web-site.</aside>
            <aside>I’ve done some truly unique things in my time as a chef and would like to continue the trend of interesting and engaging work. I’m looking for an entry-level position in which I can learn and grow while entertaining my creative side. </aside>
